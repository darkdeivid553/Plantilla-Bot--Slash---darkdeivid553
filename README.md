Definitions

The work is the literary, artistic or scientific creation offered under the terms of this license.

Limits on Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce or restrict any legal limits on the copyright owner's exclusive rights under the Copyright Act or any other applicable laws, whether arising from legitimate uses, such as private copying or quotation, or other limitations such as those resulting from the first sale of copies (exhaustion).

License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this license, the licensor grants, for the term of protection of the intellectual property rights and free of charge, a non-exclusive worldwide license that includes the following rights:

The right to transform the work to create a derivative work provided that an indication of the transformation or modification made is included in the derivative work.
For the avoidance of doubt, the original owner:
Retains the right to receive the remunerations or compensations provided for acts of exploitation of the work or performance, qualified by law as unrenounceable and inalienable and subject to compulsory collective management.
You waive the exclusive right to receive, either individually or through a collective rights management entity, any remuneration derived from acts of exploitation of the work or service that you perform.

Restrictions. The grant of rights under this license is subject and limited to the following restrictions:

You may reproduce, distribute or publicly communicate the work or performance only under the terms of this license and must include a copy of the work or performance, or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). You may not offer or impose any condition on the work or other subject matter that alters or restricts the terms of this license or the exercise of your rights by the licensees of the work or other subject matter. You may not sublicense the work or performance. You must keep intact all notices regarding this license and disclaimer of warranties. You may not reproduce, distribute or publicly communicate the work or performance with technological measures that control access or use in a manner contrary to the terms of this license. This section 4.a also applies to the work or performance embodied in a collection, but this does not mean that the collection as a whole automatically becomes or should become subject to the terms of this license. If required, upon notice from the licensor, if you incorporate the work into a collection and/or create a derivative work, you must remove any credit required by Section 4.b, to the extent possible.
If you reproduce, distribute or publicly communicate the work or performance, a collection incorporating it, or any derivative work, you must keep intact all copyright notices and indicate, in a reasonable manner consistent with the medium or media you are using:
The name of the original author, or pseudonym if applicable, as well as that of the original owner, if provided.
The name of those parties (e.g., institution, publication, journal) that the original owner and/or licensor designates to be acknowledged in the legal notice, terms of use, or in any other reasonable manner.
The title of the work or performance if provided.
The URI, if any, that the licensor specifies to be linked to the work or other subject matter, unless such URI does not refer to the legal notice or license information for the work or other subject matter.
In the case of a derivative work, a notice identifying the transformation of the work into the derivative work (e.g., "Spanish translation of Original Author's work," or "screenplay based on Original Author's original work").
This acknowledgment must be made in a reasonable manner. In the case of a derivative work or incorporation into a collection, these credits must appear at a minimum.
